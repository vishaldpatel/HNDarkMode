# HNDarkMode
This UserScript maker Hacker News colors darkmode friendly.

Here's how to use it:
1. Install your favorite UserScripts plugin for your browser. I use Tampermonkey (http://tampermonkey.net).
2. Open your Tampermonkey Dashboard found in the Tampermonkey menu.
3. Select the option to create a new script (The "+" sign). This will open up the script editor.
4. Copy and paste the contents of main.js into your script editor.
6. File -> Save
7. Refresh your hacker news page to see Hacker News in Dark Mode! =)
